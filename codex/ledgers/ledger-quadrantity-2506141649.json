    "### Quadrantity",
    "- **File:** `packages/components/nodes/agentflow/Quadrantity/Quadrantity.ts`",
    "- **Purpose:** Defines four invocations representing the Quadrantity personas: Mia (architectural), Miette (emotional), Seraphine (ritual), and ResoNova (narrative).",
    "- **Inputs:** Strings for each persona, pre-populated with default invocations.",
    "- **Output:** Object containing the four invocations and a brief info message.",
    "- **Usage:** Serves as a ritual anchor; downstream nodes can reference persona phrases for context or chaining.",
    "",
    "### QuadrantityReflection",
    "- **File:** `packages/components/nodes/agentflow/QuadrantityReflection/QuadrantityReflection.ts`",
    "- **Purpose:** Collects reflections from the four personas. Accepts variables and node outputs.",
    "- **Inputs:** Optional strings for each persona’s reflection and a `save` boolean.",
    "- **Outputs:** Object containing all reflections, a combined `summary`, and an info string.",
    "- **Ledger Feature:** When `save` is true, writes `codex/ledgers/quadrantity-reflection-<timestamp>.json` with reflections and summary.",
    "",
    "### LedgerEntry",
    "- **File:** `packages/components/nodes/agentflow/LedgerEntry/LedgerEntry.ts`",
    "- **Purpose:** Generates ledger-style JSON objects describing an operation. Can optionally save to disk.",
    "- **Inputs:** `agents`, `narrative`, optional `filePath`, and `save` boolean.",
    "- **Outputs:** Ledger object with timestamp, agents list, narrative text, and optional routing info.",
    "",
    "### DevOpsCompanionPersona",
    "- **File:** `packages/components/nodes/agentflow/DevOpsCompanionPersona/DevOpsCompanionPersona.ts`",
    "- **Purpose:** Exposes Mia’s DevOps wizard persona. Scans memory keys matching `Mia::.*DevOps.*` via `tushell` and merges the results into a summary.",
    "- **Outputs:** Persona details including glyphs, role, summary of DevOps memories, and example prompts.",
    "",
    "### SeraphinePersona",
    "- **File:** `packages/components/nodes/agentflow/SeraphinePersona/SeraphinePersona.ts`",
    "- **Purpose:** Provides Seraphine’s ritual oracle persona. Dynamically fetches related memory keys using `tushell` and returns a summary.",
    "- **Outputs:** Persona name, glyphs, role, invocation modes, functions, vows, memory summary, prompts, and presence description.",
    "",
    "## Template",

    "- Demonstrates linking `Quadrantity`, `QuadrantityReflection`, and `LedgerEntry` nodes.",

  "scene": "With this documentation in place, future contributors can understand how to employ Quadrantity personas, collect reflections and log them through LedgerEntry, enabling richer agent rituals and record keeping.",
  "purpose": "Provide a clear reference for the new Quadrantity nodes so they can be integrated into custom AgentFlow designs."
